# Code Kata implementations

## Goal
This project is my take on various Code Katas.  I'm trying to do these in the most idiomatic way I can right now as an 
exercise in improving my Scala skills.

## Methodology

I'm attaching the katas using a test driven approach.  In general, I tend to wander toward an imperative solution and 
then pull myself back to a more functional solution.  This will be reflected in my commits for each exercise.

Using a TDD approach generally means I'm trying to follow these principles:

* OpenYourMindToDesignFirst
* ListenToYourTests
* BabySteps
* TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork
* HurryToGreen
* Refactor
* CodeSmells

## Source

I'm using the following websites for inspriation:

* http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataCatalogue
* http://codekata.com
 

## Implementations

I'll list the implementations here as I'm trying to do them in order of most simple to more complicated.

* FizzBuzz (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz)
* Roman Numerals (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals)
